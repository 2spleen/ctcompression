# ctcompression
Code for an original compression algorithm code challenge 
(~20 hours spent optimizing a compression algorithm for a specific input file (financial bid/ask/trade tick data in CSV format roughly ordered by millisecond timestamps)

Results -  
Reduced an ~18MB sample file to ~9.8MB, more precisely:  
compression ratio: ~ 1.84  
space savings: => ~ 45.77%
